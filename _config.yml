# --- NAVIGATION TABS ---
# Links now point to the IDs in the single index page
header_pages:
 - index.md

# You can manually add links in your theme's navigation if needed, 
# or simply rely on the index page scrolling. 
# Since Minima auto-generates links from pages, 
# deleting the old about.md/projects.md/join.md files 
# will clean up the menu automatically.
