    Open Lunar is a hardware and infrastructure development community dedicated to lowering the barrier to entry for cislunar operations. We focus on "dumb," robust, and scalable technologies that rely on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU).
  lists:
    - title: "Core Focus Areas"
      items:
        - "**Launch Logistics:** Mass drivers, sleds, and simplified solid propulsion."
        - "**Materials Science:** Basalt fiber weaving, aluminum-oxygen combustion, and regolith sintering."
        - "**Open Hardware:** All designs are open source and documentation driven."

    ## Our Mission
    To create a library of open-source hardware designs that enable sustainable, industrial-scale operations on the lunar surface without relying on complex Earth-based supply chains.
  subsections:
    - title: "Design Philosophy"
      items:
        - "**ISRU First:** If it can't be built from lunar dirt (regolith), aluminum, or oxygen, we try not to use it."
        - "**Complexity Reduction:** We prefer 'dumb' mechanical solutions (centrifuges, sleds) over complex avionics and active guidance systems."
        - "**Modular Interoperability:** All hardware is designed to share common standards for power, data, and mechanical coupling."
