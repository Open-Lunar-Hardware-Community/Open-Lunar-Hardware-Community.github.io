## Our Mission

To create a library of open-source hardware designs that enable sustainable, industrial-scale operations on the lunar surface without relying on complex Earth-based supply chains.

## Design Philosophy

We adhere to three core principles:

1.  **ISRU First:** If it can't be built from lunar dirt (regolith), aluminum, or oxygen, we try not to use it.
2.  **Complexity Reduction:** We prefer "dumb" mechanical solutions (centrifuges, sleds) over complex avionics and active guidance systems.
3.  **Modular Interoperability:** All hardware is designed to share common standards for power, data, and mechanical coupling.
