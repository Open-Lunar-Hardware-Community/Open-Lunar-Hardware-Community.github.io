# Building the Open Source Standard for Lunar Settlement

Open Lunar is a hardware and infrastructure development community dedicated to lowering the barrier to entry for cislunar operations. We focus on "dumb," robust, and scalable technologies that rely on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU).

### Core Focus Areas
* **Launch Logistics:** Mass drivers, sleds, and simplified solid propulsion.
* **Materials Science:** Basalt fiber weaving, aluminum-oxygen combustion, and regolith sintering.
* **Open Hardware:** All designs are open source and documentation driven.
